# Coding practices in "Functional Programming in Scala Specialization"

[Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala) is a Coursera Specialization course offered by EPFL.

All codes are personal creation and uploaded after passing all quizzes. I did not learn from other people's work and did not optimize the code through discussion in forums.

If you are lucky enough to see it here and have better ideas, let me know about the issue.
